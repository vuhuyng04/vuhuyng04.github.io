Transformer models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing. These models, which rely on self-attention mechanisms, have achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of NLP tasks.

## BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers

BERT, developed by Google, is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks.

## GPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformer

GPT, developed by OpenAI, is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. It is trained with the objective of predicting the next word in a sentence given all the previous words.

## Applications of Transformer Models

Transformer models have been applied to various NLP tasks with impressive results:

- Text classification
- Named entity recognition
- Question answering
- Text generation
- Machine translation

The success of transformer models has led to a paradigm shift in NLP, moving away from task-specific architectures towards general-purpose pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.
